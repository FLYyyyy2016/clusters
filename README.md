# Clusters

[![](https://godoc.org/github.com/mpraski/clusters?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/mpraski/clusters)

Go implementations of several clustering algoritms (k-means++, DBSCAN, OPTICS), as well as utilities for importing data and estimating optimal number of clusters.

# The reason

This library was built out of a necessity for a performant and simple clustering utility for Golang. Go, thanks to its several advantages (single binary distrubution, relative performance, growing community) seems to become an attractive alternative to languages commonly used in statistical computations and machine learning. I use part of the robust gonum package to perform optimized vector calculations in tight loops.
